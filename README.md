# Project Overview 🔎
Prompted by The Data Structures University class, in this project , data structures like min and max Heap, Graph, AVL Tree and Hashtable, were implemented from scratch.

# What we learned 💡
This project was necessary to aquire deep knowledge about data structures and it was also a great way to transfer theoretical background into practice.

# Technical info ⚙️
The main method of the project is created according to the needs of the project's presentation given by the classs instructor.
All structures have been tested with a large number of data in order to insure efficiency in all cases.
Only primitive types were used to create the structures. No ready structures were used (like vectors and other structures).
The project also includes a [Presentation](https://github.com/theosavv/DataStructures/blob/main/ProjectDomesCPP/Project.pdf) in greek including further technical overview and details upon the implementation.
