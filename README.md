# DataStructures
Prompted by The Data Structures University class, in this project , data structures like min and max Heap, Graph, AVL Tree and Hashtable, are implemented from scratch.

# Implementation
The main method of the project is created according to the presentation of the project given by the instructor.
All structures have been tested with a large number of data in order to insure efficiency in all cases.
This project was necessary to aquire a deep knowledge upon data structures and a great way to transfer theoretical background into practice.
